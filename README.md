The Smart Selfie Timer project provides an innovative solution for taking selfies by using hand gestures to set a timer. Users can control the camera's timer by holding up a specific number of fingers, simplifying the process of capturing photos and eliminating the need for physical buttons or voice commands. By utilizing computer vision and gesture recognition technologies, the app detects the number of fingers raised by the user and automatically sets a countdown timer to capture the perfect selfie. This hands-free approach offers an intuitive, user-friendly experience for selfie lovers and social media enthusiasts.
